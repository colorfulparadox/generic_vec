** C Generic Vector
I made this for fun. 

Look inside of main.c to how it works. Check out vector.h in includes dir to see the methods.

I used gcc to compile. Maybe I will create a makefile or something to compile and run. 

```
gcc -pedantic -Wall --std=c17 src/main.c src/vector.c -o target/main.exe
```
